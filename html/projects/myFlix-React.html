              <div class="highlight">
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The MyFlix Client: React is a client-side application that allows users to explore a catalog of movies. Users can log in to access detailed information about movies, including actors, directors, and genres. Additionally, they can curate a personalized list of favorite movies, manage their profile, and even deregister from the app if desired. The project showcases my proficiency in building dynamic, responsive single-page applications using modern web technologies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
                <p>This project was built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, alongside Redux for state management. Bootstrap was used for styling and responsiveness, while Parcel served as the build tool. The application seamlessly integrates with the MyFlix REST API to provide users with up-to-date movie information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h2>Core Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Authentication & Profile Management:</strong> Provides secure login, registration, and profile management, allowing users to save their favorite movies and manage their account settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Utilized Bootstrap to create a user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Single-Page Application (SPA):</strong> Implemented seamless navigation within the application using React Router, enabling users to move between views without refreshing the page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Movie Filtering & Search:</strong> Leveraged Redux to handle complex state interactions, enabling dynamic movie filtering and search functionality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration with MyFlix REST API:</strong> Integrated the client-side application with the MyFlix REST API to fetch and display accurate and relevant movie data.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h2>Development & Documentation</h2>
                <p>Throughout the development of the MyFlix React application, I deepened my understanding of React’s component-based architecture and modern JavaScript practices. I enhanced my skills in state management with Redux and UI design with Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. Documentation was created to guide other developers in understanding and contributing to the project.</p>
