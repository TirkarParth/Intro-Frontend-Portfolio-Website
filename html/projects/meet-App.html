                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                  <p>The Meet App is a serverless progressive web application (PWA) built using React, designed to provide users with seamless access to upcoming events by leveraging the Google Calendar API. The application focuses on delivering a high-performance, cross-platform experience with offline capabilities and an intuitive user interface. The key features include filtering events by city, showing/hiding event details, specifying the number of events, offline functionality, and data visualization through charts.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                  <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
                  <p>This project was developed using React and the Google Calendar API, supported by serverless functions on AWS Lambda. It adheres to PWA standards, ensuring offline functionality and cross-browser compatibility. Testing was a crucial aspect, with unit, integration, and end-to-end testing conducted to ensure reliability. Performance monitoring was implemented using Atatus.</p>
